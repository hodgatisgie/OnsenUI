Kariera Nicosia Dyzmy is not only a hilarious comedy, but also a clever parody of the classic Polish literature. The film borrows many elements and motifs from the works of famous Polish writers, such as Henryk Sienkiewicz, BolesÅaw Prus and StanisÅaw Ignacy Witkiewicz. For example, the character of Nikos Dyzma is inspired by the protagonist of Quo Vadis, a historical novel by Sienkiewicz that depicts the persecution of Christians in ancient Rome. Similarly, the plot of the film resembles the novel The Doll by Prus, which tells the story of a poor clerk who falls in love with a rich aristocrat. Moreover, the film uses the technique of grotesque and absurd humor to mock the social and political realities of Poland, as well as the human condition in general, in the style of Witkiewicz's plays and novels.
 
Kariera Nicosia Dyzmy is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone who likes comedy and satire, but also by those who appreciate the Polish culture and literature. It is a film that makes you laugh, think and reflect on the world around you. It is a film that shows you that sometimes life can be stranger than fiction.
