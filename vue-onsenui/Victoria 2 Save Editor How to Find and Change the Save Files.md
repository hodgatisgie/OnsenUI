Victoria 2 is a grand strategy game by Paradox Interactive that lets you play as any country in the world from 1836 to 1936. You can shape the history of your nation through diplomacy, warfare, economy, culture, and more. But sometimes you may want to tweak some aspects of your game that are not easily accessible through the game interface. For example, you may want to change your population, your technology, your prestige, or your relations with other countries. This is where save-game editing comes in handy.

Save-game editing is a modding technique that allows you to modify the data of your saved game file using a text editor. You can change almost anything in your game by editing the right values and variables in the save file. However, this also means that you have to be careful not to mess up your game or make it unplayable. Save-game editing also prevents you from getting achievements, so keep that in mind if you care about them.
 
In this article, we will show you how to edit Victoria 2 save files step by step. We will also give you some tips and examples of what you can change and how. Let's get started!
  
## Step 1: Locate Your Save File
 
The first thing you need to do is to find your save file on your computer. Save files are located in Victoria 2's installation directory (ie C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\Common\Victoria 2\). Unlike more recent Paradox Interactive games, they are not located under Program Files[^1^]. Save files have the extension .v2 and are named after the country you are playing as and the date of the save.
 
For example, if you are playing as France in 1861, your save file may be called FRA\_1861\_01\_01.v2. You can also find your save files in your Documents/Paradox/Victoria II folder if you are using a mod[^2^]. If you have multiple save files, make sure you choose the one you want to edit and make a backup copy of it before proceeding.
  
## Step 2: Open Your Save File With a Text Editor
 
The next thing you need to do is to open your save file with a text editor. We recommend using Notepad++ or Sublime Text for this purpose, as they are more advanced and user-friendly than the default Notepad. You can download them for free from their official websites.
 
To open your save file with a text editor, right click on it and select "Open with". Then choose the text editor of your choice from the list of programs. If it is not on the list, click on "Browse" and find it on your computer. Alternatively, you can drag and drop your save file onto the text editor icon.
 
Once you open your save file with a text editor, you will see a lot of text and numbers. This is the data of your game that you can modify. However, it may not be very easy to read or understand at first glance. That's why we will explain some of the basics of how to navigate and edit your save file in the next steps.
  
## Step 3: Understand The Structure of Your Save File
 
Your save file is divided into several sections that correspond to different aspects of your game. Each section starts with a name followed by an equal sign (=) and ends with a closing curly bracket (}). For example, this is how the section for diplomacy looks like:
